# Responsive-Portfolio
The Homework for Bootcamp!
In this Portfolio you will find the following:

A welcoming home page that has a friendly face on it.
An About Me that includes:
- My job
- My education
- My hobbies
A Contact Page with the option to enter an email and a phone as well as a clickable 'Submit' button.
A Portfolio page that not only showcases my previous website and blog, but also my art.
A surprise Pets page where you can meet my dog and cats!

Two CSS files are attached - one for main styling, and an extra for later possible additions as this site grows and expands.

Most of the images are saved as JPGs to the folder, but others are linked to their direct home URLs.
